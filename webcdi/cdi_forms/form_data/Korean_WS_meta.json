Please go through the list and mark the words you have heard your child SAY on their own. If your child uses a different pronunciation of a word (for example, \"raffe\" instead of \"giraffe\" or \"sketti\" for \"spaghetti\") or says a different word that has a similar meaning as the word listed here (e.g., \"nana\" for \"grandma\"), go ahead and mark it. Remember that this is a \"catalogue\" of all the words that are used by many different children. Don't worry if your child only says a few of these right now.",
